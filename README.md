## Banker's Algorithm

This repository is an implementation of the Banker's Algorithm for
deadlock avoidance. The Banker's Algorithm runs on simulated resources
and processes.

The program is ran by [bankers-algorithm.c](../master/bankers-algorithm.c)
with

    __gcc [bankers-algorithm.c](../master/bankers-algorithm.c)__
    __./a.out < sample_input.txt__
